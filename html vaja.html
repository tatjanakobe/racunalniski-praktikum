    <h1>Persian cats</h1>

    <p>The content of this page has been slightly adapted from the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cat">Persian cat</a> </p>
    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cat -->

    <p><strong>The Persian cat</strong> is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle.
        It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in English-speaking countries.</p>

    <p>The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620. Recognized
        by the cat fancy since the late 19th century, Persian cats were first adopted by the English, and then mainly by
        American breeders after the Second World War.</p>

    <p>The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colors, but
        has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persians. Favored by fanciers, this head structure can
        bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed, there have been efforts by
        some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the <em>traditional breed</em>, having a more pronounced
        muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary polycystic kidney disease is prevalent in the breed,
        affecting almost half the population in some countries.</p>

        <p>Two traditional Persian cats</p>
    </div>

    <p>The <strong>traditional Persian</strong>, or <strong>doll-face Persian</strong>, are somewhat recent names for
        what is essentially the original breed of Persian cat, without the development of extreme features.</p>

    <p>As many breeders in the United States, Germany, Italy, and other parts of the world started to interpret the
        Persian standard differently, they developed the flat-nosed "peke-face" or "ultra-type" over time, as the result
        of two genetic mutations, without changing the name of the breed from "Persian". Some organizations, including
        the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed.
        Thus the retronym Traditional Persian was created to refer to the original type, which is still bred, mirroring
        the renaming of the original-style Siamese cat as the Traditional Siamese or Thai, to distinguish it from the
        long-faced modern development which has taken over as simply "the Siamese".</p>

    <p>Not all cat fancier groups recognize the Traditional Persian (at all, or as distinct), or give it that specific
        name. TICA has a very general standard that does not specify a flattened face.</p>


    <h2 id="health">Health</h2>

    <p>Pet insurance data from Sweden puts the median lifespan of cats from the Persian group (Persians, Chinchilla,
        Himalayan and Exotic) at just above 12.5 years, while most cats live until they are about 15 years old. 76% of this
        group lived to 10 years or more and 52% lived to 12.5 years or more. Veterinary clinic data from England shows
        an average lifespan of 12-17 years, with a median of 14.1.</p>

    <p>The modern Persian faces many health problems:</p>

    <!-- začetek neoštevilčenega seznama -->

        <ul>
            <li>
                It has a large rounded skull and shortened face and nose. This facial conformation
                makes the breed prone to breathing difficulties, skin and eye problems, and birthing difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>Anatomical abnormalities associated with brachycephalic breeds can cause shortness of breath.</li>
            
            <li>Malformed tear ducts cause epiphora, an overflow of tears onto the face, which is common but primarily cosmetic. </li>
            
            <li>Entropion, the inward folding of the eyelids, causes the eyelashes to rub against the cornea, and can lead to tearing,
                pain, infection and cornea damage.</li>
            
            <li>Similarly, in upper eyelid trichiasis or nasal fold trichiasis, eyelashes/hair from
                the eyelid and hair from the nose fold near the eye grow in a way which rubs against the cornea.</li>
            
            <li>
                Dystocia, an abnormal or difficult labor, is relatively common in Persians. Consequently, stillbirth rate is higher
                than normal, ranging from 16.1% to 22.1%, and one 1973 study puts kitten mortality rate (including
                stillborns) at 29.2%. A veterinary study in 2010 documented the serious health problems caused by the brachycephalic
            head.</li>
        </ul>
